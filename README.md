# Machine_Learning-Neural_Networks
Autoencoder, deep learning, convolution and more
These codes are part of my undergraduate program in ArtificialInllegince. The first one 
treat the learning through a basic nueral network of images. However, the codes start
increasing their efficiency when more neural layers, synapses, and backpropagation functions
are added or modified into the program.
Our editor/compiler is Borlan C.
