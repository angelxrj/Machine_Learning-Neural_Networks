# Machine_Learning-Neural_Networks
Autoencoder, deep learning, convolution and more
These codes are part of my undergraduate program in Artificial Intelligence. The first five 
treat the learning through a basic nueral network of images. However, the codes start
increasing their efficiency when more neural layers, synapses, and backpropagation functions
are added or modified into the program. 
Meanwhile the other tools instead of smooth functions as sigmoids are simple convolutions that 
manage just continuous opreations, just sum and multiplication.
Other structure of learning is the autoencoder structure to generate a series of time in order to predict
with certain order of accuracy unknown data.
